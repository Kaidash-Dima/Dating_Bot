Hi, this is my project "Dating Bot"

If you want to try it in action you can go to: https://t.me/kaidashmatchbot . 
You may need to wait half a minute for the first interaction for the bot to wake up on the server.

The bot is written in Java using the Spring framework. A PostgreSQL database was used in this project.
